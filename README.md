# What-to-watch

The What To Watch app gives you recommendations on what to watch. The original idea was to give the user a way to find new movies or shows with as little effort as possible, but that they will truly enjoy. Movies & shows are oftentimes more than just entertainment. Sometimes there's content we can watch to give us inspiration (For example, a biography of your favorite artist); othertimes we just need background noise while we work, or finally have some time to relax and watch your favorite old school cartoons. 

As of right now, as a new developer, the What To Watch App can only generate a random title based on a specific genre you feel like watching. Hence why each page is named based on the desire of what to watch, wether it's "Something Funny" or "Something Scary".

Enjoy!
