The What To Watch app gives you recommendations on what to watch; displays a suggestion based on what you 'feel' like watching. Options provided on the homepage, each suggestion personalized with the user in mind. The original idea was to give the user a way to find new movies or shows with as little effort as possible, but that they will still truly enjoy. Movies & shows are oftentimes more than just entertainment. Sometimes there's content we can watch to give us inspiration (For example, a biography of your favorite artist); othertimes we just need background noise while we work, or finally have some time to relax and watch your favorite old school cartoons. 

As of right now, as a new developer, the What To Watch App can only generate a random title based on a specific genre you 'feel' like watching. Hence why each page's name is personalized on the desire of what to watch, wether it's "Something Funny" or "Something Scary". If not too picky and would like exposure to new titles, just click on "Something Random"! 

Whenever you're looking for something new to watch, try the What To Watch App.
